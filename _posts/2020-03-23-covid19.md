Official numbers show large 'mortality rates' in Spain, France and the UK, but much lower 'mortality rates' in Austria and Germany. 

A possible explanation would be a large number of undetected cases in these countries [1]. This would imply infection numbers that are an order of magnitude larger in Spain, France, the UK and the US which yields hundreds of thousands undetected cases in the US. 

On the other hand, the mortality rate could be higher due to an overwhelmed health system. This should be visible on the attached animated graph by a sharp increase in number of deaths after a certain number of infections. Yet, it may be unrecognizable because of a large number of undetected cases in the beginning of a nation's epidemic curve causing seemingly high mortality rates.

Until today, growth rates in Europe & the US are still too high to avoid the worst case. Lower mortality rates in AT, DE & South Korea coincide with large scale testing. Anyways, we should probably look to Asia for advice. It's not their first epidemic they fight.

'mortality rate' is the number of deaths to the number of infections 7 days earlier.
